            <h1 class="text-center text-4xl pb-4">Who is TJ Hunt?</h1>
            <p class="text-xl pb-4">TJ Hunt is an automotive YouTuber based out of San Diego, CA, documenting his life
                on topics ranging from building cars, buying cars, traveling, and driving in drifting competitions.</p>
            <p class="text-xl pb-4">
                He began his YouTube journey in 2014 and I have been following him since 2015. When he started, he was
                pursuing a nursing degree at a local community college, but as his following grew and his passions
                changed, he dropped out of college to pursue YouTube full-time. He has since amassed over 2.2 million
                subscribers on YouTube and has accumulated over 705 million total views.
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl pb-5">He is sponsored by brands such as: NOS Energy, Magnaflow, Meguiars, and Valvoline.</p>

            <img src="../assets/TJHunt2.jpg" alt="TJ Hunt celebrating a 2nd place win at Hot Pits Auto Fest">
        </div>
        <div class="p-8 lg:order-last">
            <h1 class="text-center text-4xl pb-4">What Makes Him Influential?</h1>
            <p class="text-xl pb-4">TJ Hunt is influential to me for many reasons. The way that he lives his life is
                inspiring and makes me believe that anything is possible. He ends many of his videos with his mantra,
                "Keep Moving Forward." TJ believes that no matter what adversity you might face, everything will be okay
                as long as you keep moving forward. Every dream, goal, or aspiration you could ever have is attainable
                if you set your mind to it and put in the hard work necessary to achieve it. He often says, "The only
                people who fail are the ones who stop trying."
            </p>
            <p class="text-xl pb-5">
                He speaks about his use of vision boards and how he spent his days envisioning his future self having
                great success to manifest it into reality. He believes that the mind dictates our actions, so if you can
                believe that something is possible, then it will be. Another quote he lives by is, "He who thinks he can
                and he who thinks he can't are usually both right." This again serves to explain that the mind dictates
                our actions. If you believe that something is possible then you will be successful. If you believe that
                something is impossible or you don't believe that you can achieve it, then you will never be successful.
